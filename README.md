# Repository Statistics
This program analyzes all of the repositories within `repos` (not included due to size). 

## Structure
`data` holds text files generated by the analyzer

	`stats-per-repo` is all of the metrics of typed vs untyped assignments & functions within each repository

	`typed-repos` is a list of all repositories that use atleast 1 type in their python code

`repo-generator` holds a script that generated the `typed-repos` file

`sandbox` is a place to put random experimental scripts for running pytype & mypy against

`analyzer.py` is the script that will generate metrics (written to `data/stats-per-repo`)


## Docker

The docker file is used to build an environment will pytype can run in. This will copy in the `sandbox` folder to run pytype against.
